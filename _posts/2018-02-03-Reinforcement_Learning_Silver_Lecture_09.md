### 1. Multi-Armed Bandits

**1.1** What is *multi-armed bandits* problem? What is regret?

**1.2** what is the trend of total regret of greedy algorithm and $$\epsilon-greedy$$ algorithm?

**1.3** What is optimistic initialisation? What is its total regret's trend?

**1.4** What is decaying $$decaying \epsilon-Greedy$$ algorithm? Waht is its total regret's trend?

**1.5** What is *lower bound theorem*?

**1.6** How to derive *UCB algorithm*?

**1.7** What is *Bayesian UCB*?

**1.8** What is *Thompson sampling*?

**1.9** What is *information state*, how to solve it?
