### 1. Monte-Carlo Learning

**1.1** Describe First-Visit and Every-Visit Monte-Carlo policy evaluation.

**1.2** What's the two updates method in incremental Monte-Carlo updates?

### 2. Temporal-Difference Learning

**2.1** How $$V({S}_{t})$$ is updated in the situation of $$TD(0)$$? What is *TD targer* and *TD error*?

**2.2** What is the advantages and disadvantages of *TD method* comapared to *Monte-Carlo method*?

**2.3** What is the bias/varience tradeoff of *TD method* and *Monte-Carlo Method*?

**2.4** In the AB example, what is $$V(A)$$?

**2.5** What is the convergence direction of *MC method* and *TD method*?

**2.6** What is the tree graph of *MC method*, *TD method* and *Dynmamic Programming*?

**2.7** What is the *sampling* and *bootstrappint* overview of reinforcement learning? 

### 3. $$TD(\lambda)$$

**3.1** What is *n-Step TD*?

**3.2** What is *forward view of $$TD(\lambda)$$*?
