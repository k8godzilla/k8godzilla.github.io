# Lecture 05
**1. PA = LU**
**2. Symmetrical Matrix**
**3. Vector Space, Subspaces**

---
### 01. PA = LU
All invertible matrix can be transformed into PA = LU, where P is permutation matrix.

###  02. Symmetrical Matrix
\\({ R }^{ T }R\\)must be symmetrical metrix. Proof is below
$$
{ ({ R }^{ T }R) }^{ T }={ R }^{ T }{ ({ R }^{ T }) }^{ T }={ R }^{ T }R
$$
### 03. Vector Space and Subspace
##### a. What is vector space
A vector space (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. 
##### b. Vector Space Example
\\({ R }^{ 2 }\\) - all 2-dim real vectors.

\\({ R }^{ 3 }\\) - all vectors with 3 components.
  
##### c. Non Vector Space Example

The graph above is not a vector space, because the product between a vector in this space and a negative scalar will be outside of this space.

#####  d.Subspace
Subspace is a vector space that is included by another vector space.
