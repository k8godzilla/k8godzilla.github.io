### 1. On-Policy Monte-Carlo Control

**1.1** In Monte-Carlo control, does policy evaluation base on state value or state-action value? Why?

**1.2** What is $$\epsilon-Greedy Exploration$$?

**1.3** Prove that $$\epsilon-greedy$$ ensures improvement on q value.

**1.4** What is *GLIE*? How to fulfill it?

**1.5** What is *GLIE Monte-Carlo Control*?

### 2. On-Policy Temporal-Difference Learning

**2.1** What is Sarsa algorithm?

**2.2** What is the condition that ensure *Sarsa's convergence*?

**2.3** What is *n-step Sarsa*?

**2.4** What is *forward view $$Sarsa(\lambda)$$*?

**2.5** What is *backward view $$Sarsa(\lambda)$$*?

**2.6** Explain the advantage of $$Sarsa(\lambda)$$ in gridworld example.
